# Hello.
A software developer who writes in several languages.

### Low-level languages:
- C
- Rust
- Assembly (to a small extent)
### High-level languages:
- JS/TS/Node.js
- Shell
- Java (although not the biggest fan)
- HTML/CSS/PHP
- Python
- Lua
along with Apache/Nginx, SQL, etc.

Most of my repositories (ex. Bento, cyberpatriots, os) are unfortunately private for various reasons, so you'll only be able to see some of my repos.
